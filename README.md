#### Basic Blog

The aim was to create an extremely simple blogging web application which one could install on their personal system and keep using. The following
were the requirements that were kept under consideration:

_Requirements_
- The website should be easy to setup in any Linux system (Because I work with Linux on majority of my systems)
- The website should not be heavy at all. It should be as lightweight as possible.
- The website should contain minimal inclusion of external CSS/JS libraries.
- Should allow for writing the files in the local machine (because I am paranoid about others getting to know about my thoughts)

#### Installation/Setup

- **Linux** : As of now, the setting up/installation has only been tested in Linux. In order to set up, one has to follow the following instructions:

1. Create a python3 virtual environment
2. Activate the python3 virtual environment
3. Install flask module using Pip
4. Clone this repository
5. Navigate inside the cloned repository and then run the `run.py` file

And that's it, you can then access the website at `localhost:5000` or at `<ip-of-installed-machine>:5000`.

**Note**: I will keep updating this README as I add more features (if any required).
